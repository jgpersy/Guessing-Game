## Guessing game

An over engineered CLI Guessing Game!

You input your name, a lower bound, and an upper bound, and the script chooses a number within that range.

The aim of the game is to guess that number.

It displays a random hint when you guess incorrectly.

The script contains input validation, error checking, and a hint generator object.
